# Paths on squares

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/Dillo/pen/yLEYRpK](https://codepen.io/Dillo/pen/yLEYRpK).

A canvas is tessellated with squares. Lines connect the middle of the squares sides : straight for opposite side, quarter circle for contiguous side. When two lines share a same extremity, they are connected to form a longer path.
Then , added some animation for fun.
